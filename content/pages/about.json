I speak Ruby and JavaScript. I create rum-time environments with Docker, CI/CD  pipelines with Jenkins, tell tall tails with Cucumber and Grafana and as of recent, develop Front-end web applications with React, in short, _my toolkit for sailing the vast oceans of the DevOps universe_.\n\nDev-Ops is a great endeavour and not to be undertaken lightly, traversing the seas of open source with nothing but your quick wits and your trusty old vessel: _the Linux kernel_. And what do we do with all the loot? Well we keep it in wooden chests and bury it in the abandoned server rooms of obsolete technology right here on Kev's island. I bet you would like to get hold of that treasure map, HA! Well shiver me timbers, as sure as the itch on my wooden leg, I invite you on this perilous journey. You better kiss your lucky dubloon ...for luck! For the rewards of living a life of open source debauchery often come at great cost, or my leg would not have come to a gritty ends in the belly of a greedy tiger shark, aarrrrr!",
